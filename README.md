# Fork Notes
This repository is forked from the original to make it run on my computer (M1 Mac CPU), while the original repo relies on Nvidia GPU.   

## Key Changes
- Replaced the base image with `tensorflow/tensorflow:2.15.0` in `Dockerfile.tensorflow`
- Commented out fonts related lines in `Dockerfile.tensorflow`
- Commented out gpu run args in `devcontainer.json`
- Added joblib dependency to the Pipfile and created the corresponding Pipfile.lock
- Made matplotlib use "Agg" instead of "TkAgg" in files in the `idnns/plots/` directory `plot_figures.py`, `plot_gradients.py`, and `utils.py`. This means there is not longer any interactive element, but "Tk" was causing issues.
- In Docker Desktop, in General Settings enabled "Use Rosetta for x86_64/amd64 emulation on Apple Silicon"

## Usage
- You must have Docker installed beforehand
- Open the project in VSCode
- Make sure the [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension is installed (VSCode should automatically prompt you to install when it notices the devcontainer files). 
- VSCode should automatically prompt you to "Reopen in Container" with a popup on the bottom right. You can also do this by finding the bottom left corner of the VSCode window with these symbols: ><. Click and select "Reopen in Container".
- If for any reason you ever need to Rebuild or access any other commands, navigate to the search bar at the top of the VSCode window and type ">" to search for a command. Click to execute.

## Results
### The following images are proof for my midterm that this ran on my computer! ðŸ¥³

# Original README
## IDNNs
### Description
IDNNs is a python library that implements training and calculating of information in deep neural networks
[\[Shwartz-Ziv & Tishby, 2017\]](#IDNNs) in TensorFlow. The library allows you to investigate how networks look on the
information plane and how it changes during the learning.

### Prerequisites
- tensorflow r1.0 or higher version
- numpy 1.11.0
- matplotlib 2.0.2
- multiprocessing
- joblib

### Usage
All the code is under the `idnns/` directory.
For training a network and calculate the MI and the gradients of it run the an example in [main.py](main.py).
Off course you can also run only specific methods for running only the training procedure/calculating the MI.
This file has command-line arguments as follow - 
 - `start_samples` - The number of the first sample for calculate the information
 - `batch_size` - The size of the batch
 - `learning_rate` - The learning rate of the network
 - `num_repeat` - The number of times to run the network
 - `num_epochs` - maximum number of epochs for training
 - `net_arch` - The architecture of the networks
 - `per_data` - The percent of the training data
 - `name` - The name for saving the results
 - `data_name` - The dataset name
 - `num_samples` - The max number of indexes for calculate the information
 - `save_ws` - True if we want to save the outputs of the network
 - `calc_information` - 1 if we want to calculate the MI of the network
 - `save_grads` - True if we want to save the gradients of the network
 - `run_in_parallel` - True if we want to run all the networks in parallel mode
 - `num_of_bins` - The number of bins that we divide the neurons' output
 - `activation_function` - The activation function of the model 0 for thnh 1 for RelU'
 - `interval_accuracy_display` - The interval for display accuracy
 - `interval_information_display` - The interval for display the information calculation
 - `cov_net` - True if we want covnet
 - `rand_labels` - True if we want to set random labels
 - `data_dir` - The directory for finding the data
The results are save under the folder jobs. Each run create a directory with a name that contains the run properties. In this directory there are the data.pickle file with the data of run and python file that is a copy of the file that create this run.
The data is under the data directory. 

For plotting the results we have the file [plot_figures.py](idnns/plot/plot_figures.py). 
This file contains methods for plotting diffrent aspects of the data (the information plane, the gradients,the norms, etc).
